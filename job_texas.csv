At Labatt Food Service we consider ourselves a sophisticated software company that sells food. We continue to grow every year and succeed against larger competitors by being innovators and building long term relationships with our customers, vendors and employees. We are often first with new technologies. Many of our new initiatives eventually become standard across the industry and we have thus established a reputation as being a thought-leader in our industry.
Role & Responsibilities
Labatt’s developers create and continuously improve all the systems that run the business. Software and data analytics play a huge part in the success of the company, and therefore software developers have a significant impact on the company. Since the very beginning, Labatt has focused on writing all of its own code, allowing the company to move quickly into new areas and be flexible to customer needs. Our team of software developers design, test, and continually re-engineer the critical systems that keep all aspects of the business running at full steam. Developers work as members of small teams, and employ Agile methodologies to bring about the internal-efficiency and customer-facing innovations that are necessary to keep our lead in the industry. Our philosophy of investing in clean code and developing people from within allows us to build for the long term and leverage the most forward-thinking APIs, languages, and practices, to take on the most intellectually challenging projects that our industry faces.
As a software developer at Labatt, you will take on projects approximately 6 months in length, iterate on a small team of 3-5, test thoroughly, design clean & modular code, experiment, learn, be challenged, and serve the needs of the business. All developers are expected to contribute to the team's success by solving significant problems and sharing lessons learned with the group. Developers are also expected to follow the group's established coding and process best practices as established by the group to ensure quality and consistent code— code that will last for many years. Developers have a significant amount of freedom with their projects and the ability to experiment with newer technologies and practices that may help the group overall.
Our Current Stack
Developers at Labatt Food Service use a variety of technologies, including:
C#, Visual Basic, Golang, IBM RPG, Vue.js, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Docker, and SQL.
Requirements
The developers who do best at Labatt must have the ability to think both strategically and tactically, the discipline to set and hit deadlines, an appetite for hard work and continuous personal improvement, a passion for working and effectively communicating with others, and a commitment to the success of the overall organization.
Proficiency in coding and the ability to write clean, functional code is a must. We understand that developers learn and use different technologies over time. We are more interested in finding developers who can think and write code and are less interested in ""X years with Y technology"". No matter the starting skill level, developers are expected to improve over time.

We want to change the world, and we've already done it once. SpiderOak has been building encrypted software since before the first iPhone was released.
SpiderOak is committed to building secure and reliable software that protects our customers' data. Our approach is fundamentally different from most mainstream security companies. Instead of adding layers of security on top of an insecure system, we build software that is inherently secure.
SpiderOak builds need-to-know technology that supports customers working in hostile environments. Traditional systems trust IT infrastructure to maintain the whole security system, even though the news is rife with evidence that this model does not work. Our software combines end to end encryption with a distributed ledger (aka Blockchain) technology to offer best-in-class security with no backdoors.
It's time to rethink cyber security.
Historically, the first step to compromising an information system was to find access to it, or the network it operates on. Today, we've connected all systems together in a way that's put all global adversaries on our doorstep.
Our response to this ever-shifting environment is to remove all central points of compromise by implementing controls cryptographically, on a fully decentralized platform.
Working at SpiderOak offers the chance to work on applied cryptography, asynchronous distributed systems, formal methods, and domain specific languages.
We are driven by how applying cutting edge ideas can lead to foundationally secure systems in orbit and on earth.
Who We Need
Someone with experience working in Rust (and C++) who can provide us with writing reliable, maintainable code.
A curious, creative, Software Engineer with relevant work experience in an Agile/Scrum environment. You'll have a desire to continue to build your skills and knowledge in Cryptography, or you'll bring some experience with Cryptography to SpiderOak.
You will thrive at SpiderOak if you enjoy working collaboratively across cross-functional teams, with the unique ability to work in a fully remote/virtual environment. 
What You'll Do
Familiarize yourself with our current codebase and architecture.
Extend our current codebase to provide new capabilities and enhanced assurance and performance.
Help SpiderOak become exceptional at programming in Rust.
Develop and/or maintain advanced knowledge of computing system integrations and make recommendations or decisions on software and hardware configurations and developments.
Provide analysis and recommended design of applications, middleware, and system architecture to solve complex problems.
Apply a structured approach to design and implementation of systems and processes.
Translate mission and customer requirements into capabilities, testing, and validation of services.
Analyze and allocates requirements to system architecture components and oversee the development, testing, and validation of systems and services.
Coordinate the integration of systems and services and oversee deployments.
What To Expect
In the first year in the role, you'll collaborate with multiple teams in order to understand our codebase. An ability to understand hardware configurations, and how to develop or alter solutions around multiple environments, will be key to your success. 
Some travel, up to 10%, may be required.

 and we hope the Job market improves however as per a resume builder survey based on response from more than 900 companies 4 out of 10 companies are planning to have layoffs in 2024 or have a hiring freeze. 
Almost 390,000 tech employees have been laid off since 2022
 and it's still ongoing. The effect of this has led hundreds of thousands of laid off Tech employees competing with existing Jobseekers.
AI is replacing many normal jobs which were done by people. As per news reports Google is planning to Client off 30,000 employees in its ad sales who will be replaed by AI ad technology.
Entry level Job seekers struggle to get responses to their applications, are getting ghosted after interviews. 
In such a scenario the Job seekers need 
to differentiate themselves by ensuring to obtain exceptional skills and technologies so that they can wear multiple roles at a client as clients now would want to expand roles and responsibilities assigned to a particular job to save costs.
Since 2010 Synergisticit has helped Jobseekers differentiate themselves by providing candidates the requisite skills and experience to outperform at interviews and clients. Here at SynergisticIT We just don't focus on getting you a Job we make careers.

In this challenging economy every client wants to save $$$'s and they want the best value for their money. Jobseekers need to self-evaluate if they have the requisite skills to meet client requirements and needs as Clients now post covid can also hire remote workers which increases even more competition for jobseekers.
We at Synergisticit understand the problem of the mismatch between employer's requirements and Employee skills and that's why since 2010 we have helped 1000's of candidates get jobs at technology clients like 
apple, google, Paypal, western union, Client, visa, walmart lab

At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.
We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!
Position Location: Austin, TX | Lisbon, Portugal | London, UK
About The Role
Our team’s core mission is to enable developers to do what they do best — build powerful applications. We believe they should be able to do this without having to think or worry about infrastructure, scaling, or performance. While Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare’s solution to serverless computing, handles the infrastructure part, there’s so much more that goes into enabling developers to do their jobs. In this role you will work on a wide range of projects that enable our platform to integrate seamlessly with the existing Web development ecosystem, including developing and improving integration with full stack web frameworks, developer tools for bundling, transpiling, and performance optimizations. You’ll also be exposed to JS API design and standardization work, and development or integration of backwards/forwards compatibility API layers for Web and Node.js APIs. If this excites you, come join our team of talented engineers that enables developers all around the world to build low-latency planet-scale applications for the Internet and the Web!
About The Department
Our team Frameworks and ecosystem is part of Cloudflare's Emerging Technology and Incubation (ETI) team where new, bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a successful business, ETI leverages our network to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Our most successful endeavors include the Cloudflare development platform, which is composed of Cloudflare Workers, Pages, R2, D1, and many other developer products.
What You'll Do
As a member of the Frameworks & JS APIs team, you will put yourself in the shoes of developers using our development platform and make them successful in building their applications and deploying them on to our platform by creating and improving integrations with popular web frameworks, libraries, and tools. Along the way you’ll influence the JavaScript ecosystem by participating in designing JavaScript APIs, defining design patterns and architectures, as well as surfacing optimizations, that allow developers to build applications that take full advantage of our globally distributed, low latency network.
To this end, you will:
Collaborate closely with JavaScript web frameworks teams and tooling teams across the industry to ensure smooth development and production interoperability with our platform. Examples include Angular, Astro, Next, Nuxt, Qwik, Remix, Solid, SvelteKit, as well as Vite, Rollup, and many others.
Surface requirements and collaborate with internal teams to build features to support ecosystem integrations.
Contribute to open source projects across the web ecosystem in order to add features, fix issues, and improve integrations.
Build and improve libraries, and tools that improve ecosystem compatibility, and the getting started experience, like C3 (create-cloudflare CLI) and next-on-pages CLI.
Build demo applications, starter kits, and templates that enable developers to learn about our platform and get started using frameworks and libraries they are familiar with.
Participate in JavaScript API design efforts evolving our platform, as well as JavaScript standards.
Evaluate compatibility gaps between our workerd JavaScript runtime and Node.js, implement compatibility layers and polyfills to reduce developer friction when using existing libraries with our platform.
Contribute to internal and public-facing technical documentation, and author blog posts.
If applicable to ongoing projects, support the health and availability of services by being part of an on-call rotation.
Collaborate with engineers across Cloudflare, and contribute at many layers of the stack.
Leverage your creativity and developer prowess to seek out new ways to improve the platform.
About You
We want you to love it here! This role is a good fit for you if you are:
Excited by the idea of helping application developers be successful.
Experienced with and passionate about development tools, libraries, frameworks, and workflows.
Experienced in web application development, but attracted to digging a layer or two below to work on libraries, frameworks, and tools that power web application development.
Very experienced with JavaScript and TypeScript, web standards, JavaScript module systems, module resolution, code transformation, ASTs, and more.
Able to get familiar with internal architecture and workings of libraries and tools quickly, in order to propose integration strategies, or architectural adjustments.
Energized by mind-bending debugging sessions often involving unfamiliar code bases, complex build toolchains, and exotic bugs.
Excited to own your work from early discussions on.
Naturally curious and eager to take a step to learn something new, and share your learnings with others.
Above all, a collaborator and effective communicator. You want to join a team that upholds a culture of support, open and honest communication, and vulnerability, and that values collaboration over heroism. We celebrate our achievements, support each other when we make mistakes, and hold each other and our work to the highest standard.
You’ll really feel right at home if you have:
Experience using the Cloudflare Workers development platform
Experience contributing to OSS software development or maintaining OSS projects
Public speaking or developer relations skills
What Makes Cloudflare Special?
We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.
Project Galileo
: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.
Athenian Project
: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.
Path Forward Partnership
: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.
1.1.1.1
: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Creative UX developer needed to join a dynamic team delivering innovative new cloud products. Working with design and development professionals, you will develop and deliver new applications that are in-keeping with the OCI experience, but also build intuitive access to complex features.
You will be comfortable building Javascript applications, ideally within the REACT framework. Familiarity with Cloud software development is essential. All of our applications typically leverage REST APIs and so experience in developing to that architecture is essential. We would expect that the successful candidate would have at least three years of relevant development experience, and a passion for UX excellence. We work to agile principles, and continuously release and iterate to meet our goals. In addition each developer is resposnible for developing their test plans to our standard, and for maintaining a high quality threshold.
This is a fast paced team with aggressive deadlines, so you will be comfortable with delivering high quality code within anticipated deadlines. You will also enjoy working with designers and building proofs of concept where necessary in order to address design issues and best deliver features. While primarily being a developer role, someone with a design voice and a desire to contribute would be best suited.
Collaboration is fundamental to our approach - we work at a fast pace and so need to stay in touch with each other and get used to representing our progress/issues accurately in daily standups. If we do encounter issues we are unable to resolve individually we shout early and loud to secure the help needed to deliver our objectives.
Career Level - IC2
Responsibilities
As a skilled Javascript developer with REACT framework experience you will develop cloud software applications that deliver unparalleled user experiences to our customers.

Code that saves lives. 
As a software developer at Epic, you’ll write software that impacts the lives of 75% of Americans and 300 million patients around the world. Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you’ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you’ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves.
Write software for the most innovative health systems on the planet.
The top-ranked health systems in U.S. News and World Report are Epic customers. Our community includes major systems like the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, and Kaiser Permanente, as well as leading academic medical centers at the University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, University of California, University of Texas, The Ohio State University, and many more.
Experience our state-of-the-art campus, eat delicious food, and travel the world.
We don’t believe in cubicles. (Well, we believe they 
exist
, but…) Our uniquely themed campus was designed to heighten your ability to get stuff done in your office, a conference room, or by the fireplace in a comfy chair. For lunch, visit King’s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world. Staff have kayaked in Patagonia, attended a Beyoncé concert in Ireland, built a library in Tanzania, and run a marathon in Antarctica.

Epic is located just outside Madison, Wisconsin, which is the second fastest growing market for tech talent in the United States, home to the state capital, and the University of Wisconsin. Madison has received accolades for being the greenest city in America (NerdWallet), the best city for renters (SmartAsset), fittest city in America (Fitbit), and, for the gamers, is one of a handful of US cities to have a Killer Queen arcade game, located at Madison’s first arcade bar.

Code that saves lives. 
As a software developer at Epic, you’ll write software that impacts the lives of 75% of Americans and 300 million patients around the world. Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you’ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you’ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves.

For lunch, visit King’s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world.
