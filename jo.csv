Join us on the Splunk TechOps Team, empowering our customers to execute our vision making machine data accessible, usable, and valuable to everyone! The Splunk TechOps organization runs Splunk cloud, blending SRE, Systems Engineering and Service Engineering disciplines, across functional global teams. Come join a team that is striving for operational awesomeness and trying to automate the world. We have a large presence with large cloud vendors. You should have experience with architecture, deployments, and networking in one or more of the major industry vendors. This is an incredible opportunity to use your existing cloud experience and drive the growth of Splunk Cloud.
What We’re Looking For
We are looking for a Site Reliability Engineer to help maintain, contribute to and improve the next generation of our large scale Cloud offering. You will be working with providers and supporting the infrastructure that powers Splunk’s cloud offering.
YOU SHOULD APPLY IF
You have operational experience at scale. You have had hands-on roles that deal with operating systems (particularly Linux) and networking. You might also have worked with Cloud technologies. Your previous job titles might be something close to systems admin, network engineer or devops engineer.
You're passionate about your work. Our customers are passionate about Splunk and we want the same from our engineers. You should enjoy actively being responsible for your work and be excited about your projects.
You love large complex systems. Experience in working on distributed systems or a passion for finding edge cases that appear at scale. You are interested in how to bring something from a small one off task to how to implement it across several thousand machines at once.
You have some development skills. We have code in several languages, ranging from Python and Shell to Go and C++. We don’t expect you to be a software engineer but you should be familiar with basic programming and understand concepts like input sanitization and unit testing.
""How can I automate this process?"" is a question you constantly ask yourself.
Data drives your decisions. Data excites you and you make decisions based on numbers rather than assumptions. If an issue arises, you strive to be alerted before our customers notice.
You care about monitoring. Shipping code often and getting useful feedback excites you and you’re not worried about changing direction when a solution isn’t working as expected.
What We Provide
Opportunities to develop and grow as an engineer. We are always expanding into new areas, working with open-source projects and contributing back, and exploring new technologies.
A team of incredibly capable and dedicated peers, all the way from engineering to product management and customer support.
Breadth and depth. You are interested to work in an area that dynamically scales to meet the need of Splunk’s cloud offering. You want to go deep into optimizing how we automate every manual process and tedious task we encounter.
Growth and mentorship. We believe in growing engineers through ownership and leadership opportunities. We also believe that mentors help both sides of the equation.
A stable, collaborative, and supportive work environment. Honesty and collaboration are values we see as a core part of our team identity. We understand the value in open communication—working together to get things done, and to adapt to the changing needs of the team and individuals. This is reflected in both our internal communications and also in how we interact with our customers.
Balance. We don't expect people to work 12 hour days. We want you to be successful outside of work too. Want to work from home sometimes? No problem. We trust our colleagues to be responsible with their time and commitment, and believe that balance helps cultivate a positive environment.
Splunk is an Equal Opportunity Employer At Splunk, we believe creating a culture of belonging isn’t just the right thing to do; it’s also the smart thing.

Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.
We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.
Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.
These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.
But while classic, 'deb' based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.
We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.
These roles include:
Ubuntu Core and snapd software development 
Silicon software and optimisation engineers 
Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers 
Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers 
Hardware Certification Engineers 
Robotics engineers 
Industrial IoT software engineers 
Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)
At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.
Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.
What your day will look like
Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:
Work with the latest Linux kernel, RTOS, and open source technologies

Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.
These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.
But while classic, 'deb' based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.
We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.
These roles include:
Ubuntu Core and snapd software development 
Silicon software and optimisation engineers 
Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers 
Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers 
Hardware Certification Engineers 
Robotics engineers 
Industrial IoT software engineers 
Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)
At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.
Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.
What your day will look like
Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:
Work with the latest Linux kernel, RTOS, and open source technologies
Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms
Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks
Write high-quality, well-designed software
Collaborate proactively with other globally distributed teams 
Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities 
Help our customers ship their apps and SDKs on Ubuntu

Debug issues and produce high-quality code to fix them 
Contribute to technical documentation to make it the best of its kind 
Discuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions 
Participate as technical lead on complex customer engagements involving complete system architectures from cloud to edge 
Work usually from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks for company events 
What we are looking for in you
An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university

Streamlining the packaging and distribution of particularly troublesome third-party components for optimal experience by end users

While not a formal managerial role, the successful candidate will possess strong people skills and natural ability to lead engineers within the team, as well as working with other external teams to coordinate adoption and delivery.

Product teams rely on our expertise, guided templates, and training programs via Aha! Academy to be their best. We are proud to be a very different type of high-growth SaaS company. The business is self-funded, profitable, and 100% remote. We are recognized as one of the best fully remote companies to work for, champion the Bootstrap Movement , and have given over $1M to people in need through Aha! Cares . Learn more at www.aha.io .
Our team
Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
The Growth team is focused on increasing the number of users and accounts across the Aha! product suite. We do this by making our products easier to set up and understand. Our team figures out the intentions of new users who are starting trials of Aha! products — and provides value as quickly as possible during the trial experience.
We test new experiences: We work with the product and marketing teams to develop experiments meant to improve our users' onboarding experience.
We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away.
We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.
We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus on solving complex challenges. We minimize the overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.
We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with each other and with the developer community. Our engineering blog demonstrates how we tackle interesting challenges at Aha!
We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. 
Our technology
Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)
Your Experience
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
Skills
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again. You also have the below experience and skills:
Four+ years of experience working in Ruby on Rails
Builder of scalable, efficient, and maintainable architectures
Experience developing features at a high-growth SaaS company
Active collaborator with product teams
Your work at Aha!
